# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

The main focus of this project was to draw upon all the key understandings of HTML, CSS and JS coding and bring them together to create a fully functioning webpage.
The project successfully manages to outline the clear differences between HTML, CSS and JS code functionality in web development.
HTML is the structural framework of the webpage, CSS is the colour and design, JavaScript dictates web functionality.
